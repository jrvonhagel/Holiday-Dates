# HolidayDateList
List of US Holiday dates with indicators for if Federal, Bank, or NYSE observed holiday

Contains list of US holiday dates from 2010-2020, with separate flag columns indicating
if each date is an observed US Federal, Bank, and/or NYSE holiday. 

Contains sources where dates found, as well as information on how special circumstances handled
(e.g., holidays falling on weekend days)

I compiled this for use with a database date dimension table, to set holiday indicator columns.
